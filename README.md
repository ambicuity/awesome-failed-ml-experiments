## 🎯 Purpose

Learning from failures is one of the most valuable skills in machine learning. This repository collects **real-world ML experiments that failed**, complete with:

- What was tried
- Why it failed
- What was learned

By sharing our failures, we help others avoid the same pitfalls and accelerate the entire ML community's learning.
